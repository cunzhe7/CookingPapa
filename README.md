Cooking Papa, our game programming final project.

We implemented all the scripts and most of the sounds. We used some prefab for environment setting and ingredients.




How to play:

1. Download the CookingPapa unitypackage, there're three scenes included. On build setting, add Kitchen scene with #0, start scene with #1, and cleaner scene with #2, and start the game.

2. Use unity to import this project directly, and play on unity.

3. Run the executable file to play.(It will start at the kitchen scene)
